        <h2>Five Reasons to Love Dogs!</h2> 
        <p>
        It’s no secret I’m a dog person—I’ve lived with a dog by my side since I was 4 years old. And as any dog caregiver knows, dogs are smart, fun, complex, interesting and generally awesome creatures. Here are 13 of the coolest (and some super surprising!) scientifically backed characteristics about dogs:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. They can read our emotions—if we’re happy, sad or angry. 
        <br>
        2. They prefer new toys to old toys. This ties into the fact that dogs are intelligent creatures.
        <br>
        3. For dogs, yawns are contagious. Just like us! So next time you open wide and yawn, take a sneak peek at your dog to see if he copies you.
        <br>
        4. Oxytocin spikes in both species when dogs and humans share a mutual gaze. This explains why when we meet eyes, I feel like we really are bonding and connected. The scientists even compared it to “human mother-infant relations.” 
        <br>
        5.  Dogs feel jealousy. Jealousy is a very humanlike emotion—and it amazes me that dogs really can and do feel it. Of course, any dog owner could have told the researchers this (including me), but it’s nice to know it’s backed by science.
